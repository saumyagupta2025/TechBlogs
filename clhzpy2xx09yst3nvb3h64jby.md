## Introduction:

I recently cleared the **AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals** exam! It was an incredible journey that helped me establish a strong foundation in Azure fundamentals. Microsoft Azure, a renowned cloud computing platform, has been gaining immense popularity in recent years. In this blog, I want to take you through my experience, providing valuable insights into the AZ-900 exam. I'll cover who should consider taking this exam, the question patterns you can expect, the resources I relied on during my preparation, and wrap it up with a conclusive summary.

## Overview of the Exam:

The AZ-900 exam, also known as the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam, serves as an entry point into the world of Azure and cloud computing. It is designed to assess your understanding of basic cloud concepts and fundamental Azure services. By clearing this exam, you demonstrate your proficiency in foundational Azure knowledge, enabling you to pursue further certifications and career opportunities within the Azure ecosystem.

### Who Should Take the AZ-900 Exam

The AZ-900 exam is ideal for individuals who are new to cloud computing and want to familiarize themselves with Azure. It is suitable for:

1. IT professionals who wish to expand their knowledge and understanding of Azure fundamentals.
    
2. Non-technical professionals who want to gain a high-level understanding of Azure to better collaborate with technical teams.
    
3. Students or enthusiasts interested in pursuing a career in cloud computing.
    

### Question Patterns and Formats

The AZ-900 exam primarily consists of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). While the majority of the questions are in the MCQ format, it's important to note that Microsoft occasionally introduces new question formats to enhance the exam experience and better assess candidates' knowledge. Therefore, it is possible to encounter variations in question types, such as:

1. **Multiple Correct Answers:** In some instances, you may come across questions that require selecting multiple correct answers from the given options. These questions typically indicate the number of correct choices to be selected.
    
2. **Match the Following:** Microsoft may include "Match the Following" questions, where you are presented with two columns containing items or statements. Your task is to match the items/statements from one column to the corresponding items/statements in the other column.
    

While these alternative question formats are not as prevalent as the standard MCQs, it's essential to be prepared for potential variations during the exam.
